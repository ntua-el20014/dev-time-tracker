TODO / Ideas for Improvements

- [x] Schedule sessions in advance (show them in the calendar, and get notified one day before the session and the same day, each time you login until you actually record)
- [ ] Weekly/monthly reports: Generate and display reports for longer periods.
- [ ] Integration with calendar/task apps: Link sessions to calendar events or tasks.
- [ ] Cloud sync: Sync data across devices (optional, with user opt-in).
- [ ] Admin profile to monitor all users and statistics.
