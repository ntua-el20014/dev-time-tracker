# Dev Time Tracker

A privacy-focused, cross-platform time tracker built for developers.  
Tracks your coding sessions, editor and language usage, and helps you understand and improve your workflow—all while keeping your data local.

---

## 🚀 Features

### **Core Tracking**

- **Automatic Tracking:**  
  Monitors time spent in code editors (like VSCode) and logs active window data every 10 seconds.
- **Session Management:**  
  Start/pause/stop recording sessions, add titles and descriptions, edit or delete past sessions, add colored tags, set idle timeout. Great for tracking focused work periods.
- **User Profiles:**  
  Create multiple user profiles to track different coding activities separately.

### **Analytics & Visualization**

- **📊 Customizable Charts:**  
  Create interactive charts from your data with multiple chart types (bar, line, pie, doughnut). Group by date, language, editor, tags, day of week, or hour of day. Show total time, session count, or average duration.
- **Detailed Summaries:**  
  View summaries by day or by session, with interactive tables and filtering options.
- **Timeline & Calendar:**  
  Visualize your coding activity with a weekly timeline and a monthly calendar.
- **Editor & Language Stats:**  
  See which editors and programming languages you use most through charts and statistics. Editor and language icons are shown where available.

### **Productivity & Goals**

- **Daily Goals:**  
  Set daily coding time goals with progress tracking and completion status.
- **Goal History:**  
  View your goal completion history and track your consistency over time.

### **User Experience**

- **Global Hotkeys:**  
  Control tracking (start, pause, stop) from anywhere and switch between tabs using keyboard shortcuts.
- **Customizable Themes:**  
  Switch between dark and light mode, pick custom accent colors for each theme.
- **Admin Panel:**  
  Export/import database, backup and restore functionality.

### **Privacy & Data**

- **Local-First:**  
  All data is stored locally—your privacy is respected.
- **Database Population Script:**  
  Easily populate your database with realistic dummy data for testing and development.
